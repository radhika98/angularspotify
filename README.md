# angularspotify


This is a Spotify app using the web platform [Angular](https://angular.io/) and the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/). I wanted to create a simple web page that used the Spotify Web API to look up music, artists and album. The Spotify API differs from others as you need to get authrization to use the API. 

To use this app: 
1) cd into the directory that contains the source files 
2) run npm install 
3) run npm start and the app should load on the local server.
